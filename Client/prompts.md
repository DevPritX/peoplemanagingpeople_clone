# There will be some different Features for Users and Admin

<!-- !

    ? User can create, update & delete their account.
    ? User can create, update & delete their post.
    ? But a user can not update & delete a post that uploaded by an different user.
    ? User can change the theme or appearance of the site
    ? user can access all the routes except "admin/" routes

! Admin Features
    ? Admin have some special pages or sections and features.
    ? Admin can modify everything like all the sections, and everything like: all users posts can be updated or modified by admin but when an user's post will be updated by admin it will be show in a badge "admin updated".
    ? Admin also update & delete posts of users.
    ? Admin can create an user and delete an user
    ? Admin can make a "normal user" to a "Super User" or "Admin"
    ? To achieve all this "Supper Powers" of admin you need to go through "admin/" routes
